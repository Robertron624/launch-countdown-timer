## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

With this project I learned a lot of Dates and how to manipulate them in JavaScript. I also learned how to use Svelte and how to use it with Sass, it was really easy to use and I really liked it, I think Svelte is a great and easier alternative to React and Vue.

### Continued development

I want to keep testing my skills with Svelte and Sass, I think they are great tools and I want to keep learning them. I also want to keep learning more about JavaScript and how to manipulate dates and times. After working with Svelte I want to try other frameworks like Angular and Solid.
